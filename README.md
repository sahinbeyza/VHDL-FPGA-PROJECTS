# VHDL-FPGA-PROJECTS

Welcome to the VHDL-FPGA-PROJECTS repository! This repository contains a collection of my FPGA projects using VHDL.
The projects in this repository are written for educational and learning purposes. Further development and testing may be required. 
They were written for Digital2 course labs. Nexsys4 DDR FPGA Board was used.
